 Kinetic Modeling of Phenol Steam Reforming in a Packed Bed Reactor July 2025 – Nov 2025
Dr. Tarak Mondal, Associate Professor - IIT Ropar
– Developed a kinetic model for phenol steam reforming in a packed bed reactor to predict conversion profiles.
– Implemented power-law kinetics in MATLAB and studied the effect of pressure on phenol conversion.
– Extended the model to a LHHW framework to capture adsorption-controlled non-linear kinetics.
– Estimated kinetic parameters using MATLAB-based regression and compared power-law and LHHW reactor performance.
